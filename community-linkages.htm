                83% of the household do not have access to safe water supply. In this regard, the Chemical Engineering
                Faculty of DLSU teamed up with the Civil Engineering Faculty and Behavioral Sciences Faculty, the
                Polytechnic University of the Philippines Mulanay (PUP Mulanay) and the local government of Mulanay to
                address this issue. The community engagement entailed an integrated water management system installed and
                demonstrated in: - Model House (situated in Gawad Kalinga Housing) - Actual Households (3) - 1 in the Gawad
                Kalinga Housing - 2 in the more remote areas - PUP-Mulanay</p>

            <p class="program-description">The Department of Chemical Engineering participated in the Philippine Science
                High School system summer internship program. The department served as a host to up to 39 year 10 and 11
                Philippine Science students from different campuses across the Philippines (Bicol Region, Cordillera
                Administrative Region, Central Luzon, Central Mindanao, Cagayan Valley, Central Visayas, Ilocos Region,
                Main Campus, Southern Mindanao and Western Visayas) per year from 2016-2019. The goal of the program is to
                immerse the HS students to the research practice in a university setting with research advisers (DLSU ChE
                professors). All the students took and passed the Laboratory safety seminar and quiz administered by Dr.
                Luis F. Razon. Each group conducted some industrial chemistry experiments “Nature’s Kitchen” (given by the
                Chemical Engineering Society). As a culminating activity of the SIP, each group (composed of 3 members per
                group) presented their research proposal. All students received certificates for passing the Laboratory
                Safety Quiz, and also for participating in the Research Colloquium. Top three presenters were also
                recognized and given some prizes.</p>
